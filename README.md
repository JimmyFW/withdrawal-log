Intro

YouTube has made it too easy for me to enter the unending spiral of video-watching. I'm running an experiment to change my browsing behavior. I built a Chrome extension called [cold-turkey](https://github.com/jwjimmy/cold-turkey) to alter my YouTube interface and challenge me to record my reasons for using the app.

This Django app serves as the backend to cold-turkey. It stores my YouTube visits and reasons for visiting.
